## Why a blog?
I started this blog for three reasons - solidifying what I learn through repetition, hoping to help other learners along the way, and as an archive / showcase for what I have learnt.

<br>

## How to use

Though the most probable way you'll come across an article on my blog is through google searches for your required topic, all my writings are organized by category for the reader to explore.

The three main categories are :
- How-tos : Tutorials and explanations for stuff related to OSes, hardware and computers in general
- Rooms / CTFs walkthroughs : The primary reason I'm creating my blog is to repeat such information that I learnt
- Other stuff : Will be further subdivided into intuitive categories
